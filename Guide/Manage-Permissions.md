# Managing Permissions Guide

This is the core functionality of the RLS Manager - creating, editing, and publishing Row-Level Security permissions through an intuitive visual interface.

## Overview

The Manage Permissions page allows you to:

- 🔍 **Select** a region and DataSet to secure
- ➕ **Create** permissions for users and groups
- ✏️ **Edit** existing permissions
- 🗑️ **Delete** unwanted permissions
- 🚀 **Publish** changes to QuickSight
- 📊 **Monitor** publishing progress
- ⏮️ **Rollback** to previous versions
- 📥 **Export** permissions as CSV

```

**Time Required**: 
- Creating permissions: 2-5 minutes
- Publishing: 2-5 minutes (depending on SPICE ingestion)
- Total: 5-10 minutes per DataSet

---

## Getting Started

Before managing permissions, ensure you've completed:
- ✅ [Installation](Install.md)
- ✅ [Initialization](Initialization.md) with at least one region configured

### Important: Manageable vs Un-Manageable DataSets

**Manageable DataSets** (🟢 PUBLISHED):
- Created from standard data sources (S3, Redshift, Athena, etc.)
- Can be automatically published via API
- Permissions show 🟢 PUBLISHED status after publishing
- Full automation available

**Un-Manageable DataSets** (🟠 MANUAL):
- Created by uploading files directly to QuickSight
- Cannot be managed via QuickSight API
- Permissions show 🟠 MANUAL status (always)
- RLS Manager helps create permissions, but you must manually download CSV and upload to QuickSight
- See [Working with MANUAL Permissions](#working-with-manual-permissions) for details

## Step 1: Select a Region

Choose the AWS region where your DataSet is located.

### Region Selection

1. **Navigate to Manage Permissions** page
2. **Select a Region** from the dropdown
3. **View Region Details** displayed below

**Don't see your region?** 
- Ensure it was added during [Initialization](Initialization.md)
- Or add it via **Global Settings** page

![Manage Permissions](/Guide/images/ManagePermissions-01.png)

### Region Details Dashboard

Once a region is selected, you'll see comprehensive information:

#### 💾 SPICE Capacity

Displays your SPICE subscription status in the selected region:

- **Total Capacity** - Your SPICE subscription size (GB)
- **Used Capacity** - Currently consumed SPICE (GB)
- **Free Capacity** - Available SPICE for new DataSets (GB)
- **Usage Percentage** - Visual indicator of capacity utilization

**Why This Matters**:
- RLS DataSets are created in SPICE mode
- Publishing requires available SPICE capacity
- If capacity is full, publishing will fail
- Consider upgrading SPICE or removing unused DataSets

**Capacity Guidelines**:
- 🟢 **< 80% Used** - Healthy, plenty of space
- 🟡 **80-95% Used** - Monitor closely, consider cleanup
- 🔴 **> 95% Used** - Critical, publishing may fail

#### 📊 DataSet Summary

Shows DataSet statistics for the selected region:

**Manageable DataSets**:
- Can be managed through the RLS Manager
- Created via QuickSight UI with standard sources
- Created via QuickSight API
- Support RLS operations

**Un-Manageable DataSets**:
- Cannot be managed via API (QuickSight limitation)
- Examples:
  - DataSets created by uploading files directly to QuickSight
  - Legacy DataSets with unsupported configurations
  - DataSets with certain data prep transformations
- **These DataSets CAN appear in the dropdown**
- Permissions for these will have 🟠 MANUAL status
- You must manually download CSV and upload to QuickSight

**Created with RLS Manager**:
- RLS DataSets created by this tool
- Tagged with `RLS-Manager: True`
- Automatically managed and updated
- Don't appear in the DataSet selection (they're RLS DataSets, not main DataSets)

#### 🏗️ Regional Resources

Displays IDs of AWS resources created during region initialization:

- **S3 Bucket** - `qs-managed-rls-[UUID]`
- **Glue Database** - `qs-managed-rls-[UUID]`
- **QuickSight DataSource** - `qs-managed-rls-[UUID]`

**Use Cases**:
- Debugging issues
- Manual data inspection
- CloudWatch log analysis
- Direct S3 access for CSV files

⚠️ **Warning**: Manual changes to these resources can break the RLS Manager. Only modify if you know what you're doing.

## Step 2: Select a DataSet

Choose the DataSet you want to secure with Row-Level Security.

### DataSet Selection

1. **Select a DataSet** from the dropdown
2. **View DataSet Details** displayed below
3. **Review existing permissions** (if any)

**What appears in the dropdown?**
- ✅ Manageable DataSets (can auto-publish via API)
- ✅ Un-manageable DataSets (require manual CSV upload)
- ✅ DataSets NOT created by RLS Manager
- ❌ RLS DataSets (they're for permissions, not data)

**Note**: Un-manageable DataSets will show permissions with 🟠 MANUAL status

**Don't see your DataSet?**
- Check if it's manageable (not a file upload)
- Refresh data from **Global Settings** page
- Verify it exists in the selected region
- See [Initialization Guide](Initialization.md) for troubleshooting

**View all DataSets**: Navigate to **DataSets List** page for complete inventory

![Manage Permissions](/Guide/images/ManagePermissions-02.png)

### DataSet Details

Once selected, comprehensive DataSet information is displayed:

#### Basic Information

**Name** - Display name in QuickSight
**ID** - Unique DataSet identifier
**ARN** - Amazon Resource Name (for IAM policies)

#### Configuration

**Import Mode**:
- 🔵 **SPICE** - Data cached in-memory for fast queries
- 🟢 **DIRECT_QUERY** - Real-time queries to data source

**Manageable**:
- ✅ **Yes** - Can auto-publish via API (permissions will be 🟢 PUBLISHED)
- ❌ **No** - Requires manual CSV upload (permissions will be 🟠 MANUAL)

**Created** - When the DataSet was first created
**Last Updated** - Most recent modification timestamp

#### RLS Status

The RLS status indicator shows the current state:

**🔴 DISABLED**:
- No RLS currently applied
- All users see all data
- Ready to add RLS via RLS Manager

**🟢 ENABLED (Green)**:
- RLS is active and managed by RLS Manager
- Permissions controlled through this interface
- Safe to edit and publish changes

**🟠 ENABLED (Orange)**:
- RLS is active but managed directly in QuickSight
- Not controlled by RLS Manager
- You can take over management by publishing new permissions

#### RLS DataSet Information

If RLS is enabled, you'll also see:

**RLS DataSet ID** - The DataSet containing permission rules
**RLS DataSet Name** - Usually `[DataSet Name]-RLS`
**Version** - Current published version number
**Last Published** - When permissions were last updated

## Step 3: Manage Permissions

Create, edit, and delete permissions for users and groups.

### Adding Permissions

Create new permissions to control data access for users or groups.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Click "Add Permission"** button

2. **Select Principal Type**
   - **User** - Individual QuickSight user
   - **Group** - QuickSight group (recommended for easier management)

3. **Select User or Group**
   - Choose from the dropdown list
   - List shows all users/groups from Management Region
   
   **Don't see a user/group?**
   - Refresh data from **Global Settings** page
   - Verify user/group exists in QuickSight
   - Check Management Region is correctly configured

4. **Define Permission Rules**

   **Option A: Grant Full Access**
   - Toggle **"Sees All"** button ON
   - User/group sees ALL data in the DataSet
   - No field-level filtering applied
   - Useful for admins or managers

   **Option B: Field-Level Filtering**
   - Toggle **"Sees All"** button OFF
   - **Select Field** from dropdown (DataSet columns)
   - **Enter Values** - Comma-separated list
   - User/group sees only rows matching these values

5. **Click "Create Permission"**

![Manage Permissions](/Guide/images/ManagePermissions-03.png)

#### Permission Examples

**Example 1: Regional Manager**
```
Type: User
User: john.smith@company.com

Values: US-West, US-East
Result: John sees only US-West and US-East data
```

**Example 2: Sales Team**
```
Type: Group
Group: Sales-Team
Field: Department
Values: Sales
Result: Sales team members see only Sales department data
```

**Example 3: Executive Access**
```
Type: User
User: ceo@company.com

### Viewing Permissions

Once permissions are created, they appear in the permissions table.

#### Permissions Table

**Grouped by User/Group**:
- All permissions organized by principal
- Easy to see who has access to what
- Color-coded status indicators

**Columns**:
- **Type** - User or Group
- **Name** - User email or group name
- **Field** - Filtered field (or "All" if Sees All)
- **Values** - Allowed values (or "All Data")
- **Status** - PENDING, PUBLISHED, FAILED, or MANUAL
- **Actions** - Edit and Delete buttons

#### Quick Status Reference

| Status | Color | Meaning | In QuickSight? | Action Needed |
|--------|-------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| 🟡 PENDING | Yellow | Created/edited, not published | ❌ No | Publish to activate |
| 🟢 PUBLISHED | Green | Successfully published via API | ✅ Yes | None (active) |
| 🔴 FAILED | Red | Publishing failed | ❌ No | Fix error, republish |
| 🟠 MANUAL | Orange | Un-manageable DataSet | Depends | Download CSV, upload manually |

#### Status Indicators

Permissions can have four different statuses:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  PERMISSION STATUS LIFECYCLE                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    CREATE/EDIT              PUBLISH              SUCCESS
   ┌──────────┐           ┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐

        │                   FAILURE                  EDIT
        │                      ↓                      ↓
        │                 ┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐
        └─────────────────│🔴 FAILED │          │🟡 PENDING│
                          │          │          │          │
                          └──────────┘          └──────────┘

    UN-MANAGEABLE DATASET
   ┌──────────┐
   │🟠 MANUAL │  ──→  Download CSV  ──→  Manual Upload to QuickSight
   │          │       (Always MANUAL)
   └──────────┘
```

**🟡 PENDING** (Yellow):
- Permission created/edited but not yet published
- Not yet active in QuickSight
- Stored only in RLS Manager (DynamoDB)
- Can be edited or deleted freely
- Requires publishing to take effect

**🟢 PUBLISHED** (Green):
- Permission successfully published to QuickSight
- Currently active and enforcing data access
- Stored in both RLS Manager and QuickSight
- Edits create PENDING status (requires republishing)
- Users see filtered data based on these permissions

**🔴 FAILED** (Red):
- Publishing attempt failed for this permission
- Not active in QuickSight
- Error occurred during publish workflow
- Check logs for specific error details
- Fix the issue and republish

**🟠 MANUAL** (Orange):
- Permission is for an **un-manageable DataSet** (e.g., file upload DataSets)
- Cannot be automatically published via API
- RLS Manager generates the CSV for you
- You must manually download CSV and upload to QuickSight
- Permissions tracked in RLS Manager but applied manually
- Status remains MANUAL even after you upload to QuickSight

![Manage Permissions](/Guide/images/ManagePermissions-06.png)

---

### Editing Permissions

Modify existing permissions directly in the table.

#### What Can Be Edited

- ✅ **Filter Values** - Change the allowed values
- ✅ **Sees All Toggle** - Switch between full access and filtered
- ❌ **User/Group** - Cannot change (delete and recreate instead)
- ❌ **Field** - Cannot change (delete and recreate instead)

#### How to Edit

1. **Click Edit icon** (pencil) in the Actions column
2. **Modify values** in the inline editor
3. **Click Save** to confirm changes
4. **Status changes to PENDING** (requires republishing)

#### Inline Editing

- Changes are immediate in the UI
- Stored in DynamoDB instantly
- NOT applied to QuickSight until published
- Can be reverted before publishing

#### Status Changes When Editing

- **PUBLISHED** → **PENDING** - Edited permission needs republishing
- **PENDING** → **PENDING** - Still pending, just modified
- **FAILED** → **PENDING** - Fixed permission ready to retry
- **MANUAL** → **MANUAL** - Still manual (un-manageable DataSet), download new CSV

---

### Deleting Permissions

Remove permissions that are no longer needed.

#### How to Delete

1. **Click Delete icon** (trash) in the Actions column
2. **Confirm deletion** in the popup dialog
3. **Permission removed** from the table
4. **Deletion marked as PENDING** (requires republishing to remove from QuickSight)

#### Important Notes

- Deletion is immediate in the UI
- Removed from DynamoDB instantly
- NOT removed from QuickSight until published
- Can be undone by recreating before publishing

#### Status-Specific Deletion Behavior

- **PUBLISHED** - Deleted from UI, marked for removal, requires publishing to remove from QuickSight
- **PENDING** - Deleted from UI, never made it to QuickSight, no publishing needed
- **FAILED** - Deleted from UI, was never in QuickSight, no publishing needed
- **MANUAL** - Deleted from UI, you must manually remove from QuickSight (download new CSV, upload)

#### Bulk Deletion

To delete multiple permissions:
1. Delete each permission individually
2. All deletions are batched
3. Publish once to apply all changes

---

### Pending Changes Warning

After creating, editing, or deleting permissions, you'll see:

⚠️ **"You have unpublished changes"** warning banner

**Why This Design?**

1. **Batch Operations** - Make multiple changes, publish once
2. **Review Before Apply** - Check changes before affecting users
3. **Error Prevention** - Catch mistakes before they impact production
4. **API Efficiency** - Fewer API calls to AWS services

**What's Pending?**

The warning shows:
- Number of permissions added
- Number of permissions modified
- Number of permissions deleted
- Last change timestamp

**Next Step**: Publish changes to apply them to QuickSight

---

## Step 4: Publish Permissions

Apply your changes to QuickSight and activate RLS.

### How to Publish

**For Manageable DataSets** (Automated):
1. **Review pending changes** in the permissions table
2. **Click "Publish"** button
3. **Monitor progress** in the Status section
4. **Wait for completion** (2-5 minutes typically)
5. **Verify success** - Status shows 🟢 PUBLISHED

**For Un-Manageable DataSets** (Manual):
1. **Review permissions** with 🟠 MANUAL status
2. **Click "Export CSV"** section
3. **Download CSV** file
4. **Open QuickSight Console**
5. **Navigate to DataSet → Permissions**
6. **Upload CSV** manually
7. **Status remains 🟠 MANUAL** (this is expected)

### Monitoring Progress

The UI shows real-time progress:

- **Current Step** - Which step is executing
- **Step Status** - Success, In Progress, or Failed
- **Duration** - Time elapsed for each step
- **Logs** - Detailed execution logs
- **Overall Progress** - Percentage complete

### Publishing Duration

**Typical Timeline**:
- Validation: ~5 seconds
- S3 Upload: ~10 seconds
- Glue Table: ~15 seconds
- RLS DataSet: ~30 seconds
- Apply RLS: ~20 seconds
- Check Ingestion: 0-300 seconds (depends on data size)

**Total**: 2-5 minutes (most cases)

### What Happens During Publishing

1. **CSV Generation** - Permissions converted to QuickSight RLS format
2. **Version Creation** - New version number assigned
3. **S3 Storage** - CSV uploaded with versioning enabled
4. **Metadata Update** - Glue table schema updated
5. **DataSet Creation** - RLS DataSet created or updated
6. **RLS Application** - Main DataSet linked to RLS DataSet
7. **SPICE Ingestion** - Data loaded into QuickSight
8. **Status Update** - Permissions status updated based on result

### Status Updates During Publishing

**Before Publishing**:
- All changed permissions show 🟡 PENDING

**During Publishing**:
- Publishing workflow executes (6 steps)
- Progress shown in real-time
- Logs available for monitoring

**After Successful Publishing**:
- ✅ All permissions marked as 🟢 PUBLISHED
- ✅ Version number increments
- ✅ Pending changes warning disappears
- ✅ Permissions active in QuickSight

**After Failed Publishing**:
- ❌ Failed permissions marked as 🔴 FAILED
- ❌ Successful permissions marked as 🟢 PUBLISHED (partial success possible)
- ❌ Error details in CloudWatch logs
- ❌ Version may or may not increment (depends on failure point)

### Success Confirmation

When publishing completes successfully:

✅ **All steps show green checkmarks**
✅ **Status changes to "Published"**
✅ **Version number increments**
✅ **Pending changes warning disappears**
✅ **All permissions show 🟢 PUBLISHED status**

### Partial Success Handling

Sometimes publishing partially succeeds:

**Scenario**: 10 permissions, 8 succeed, 2 fail
- 8 permissions → 🟢 PUBLISHED (active in QuickSight)
- 2 permissions → 🔴 FAILED (not active)
- Version increments (partial success still creates version)
- Fix failed permissions and republish

**Why Partial Success Occurs**:
- Individual permission validation issues
- User/group doesn't exist
- Field name mismatch
- Invalid characters in values
- Data type incompatibility

### Testing RLS

After publishing, verify RLS is working:

1. **Open QuickSight Console**
2. **Navigate to the DataSet**
3. **Check RLS settings** - Should show RLS DataSet linked
4. **Test with different users**:
   - Log in as a restricted user
   - Open a dashboard using the DataSet
   - Verify only permitted data is visible

#### Viewing Version History

1. **Open "Version History" section**
2. **See all published versions**:
   - Version number
   - Published timestamp
   - Number of permissions
   - Published by (user)
   - Status (Current or Previous)

#### Version Information

Each version shows:
- **Version Number** - Incremental (1, 2, 3...)
- **Published Date** - When it was published
- **Permission Count** - Total permissions in this version
- **Status** - Current (active) or Previous
- **Actions** - View details, Download CSV, Rollback

### Rollback to Previous Version

Revert to a previous permission configuration.

#### When to Rollback

- ❌ Published incorrect permissions
- ❌ Users reporting access issues
- ❌ Need to undo recent changes
- ❌ Testing different permission configurations

#### Rollback Workflow

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ROLLBACK WORKFLOW                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    Select Version
         ↓
    Preview Changes
         ↓
    Confirm Rollback
         ↓
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Creates NEW version with old permissions                │
    │ (Does NOT delete current version)                       │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Publishing Workflow
    (Same 6 steps as normal publish)
         ↓
    ✅ Rolled Back Successfully
```

#### How to Rollback

1. **Open "Version History" section**
2. **Select previous version** to restore
3. **Click "Rollback"** button
4. **Review changes** in the preview dialog:
   - Permissions that will be added
   - Permissions that will be removed
   - Permissions that will change
5. **Confirm rollback**
6. **Monitor publishing progress**
7. **Verify success**

#### Important Notes

- ✅ **Safe Operation** - Creates new version, doesn't delete history
- ✅ **Full Audit Trail** - All versions preserved
- ✅ **Can Rollback Again** - Can undo the rollback
- ⚠️ **Requires Publishing** - Goes through full publish workflow
- ⚠️ **Takes Time** - Same duration as normal publish (2-5 minutes)

#### Rollback Example

```
Current State:
Version 3 (Current) - 150 permissions
Version 2           - 145 permissions
Version 1           - 120 permissions

Action: Rollback to Version 2

Result:
Version 4 (Current) - 145 permissions (copy of Version 2)
Version 3           - 150 permissions
Version 2           - 145 permissions
Version 1           - 120 permissions
```

### Import Permissions (Bulk Upload)

Import permissions from a CSV file for bulk operations.

#### When to Use

- 📥 **Initial Setup** - Import many permissions at once
- 📥 **Migration** - Move permissions from another system
- 📥 **Bulk Updates** - Update many permissions efficiently
- 📥 **Disaster Recovery** - Restore from backup

#### CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV must follow QuickSight RLS format:

```csv
UserName,GroupName,Field1,Field2,Field3
john@company.com,,Value1,Value2,Value3
,GroupName,Value1,Value2,Value3
```

**Rules**:
- First row: Headers (UserName, GroupName, then your field names)
- UserName OR GroupName must be filled (not both)
- Field columns match your DataSet fields
- Values are exact matches (case-sensitive)
- Empty values mean no restriction for that field

#### How to Import

1. **Prepare CSV file** following format requirements
2. **Click "Import Permissions"** button
3. **Select CSV file** from your computer
4. **Review preview** of permissions to be imported
5. **Choose import mode**:
   - **Replace All** - Delete existing, import new
   - **Merge** - Add to existing, skip duplicates
   - **Update** - Add new, update existing
6. **Click "Import"**
7. **Review results** - Shows success/error count
8. **Publish changes** to apply

#### Import Validation

The system validates:
- ✅ CSV format is correct
- ✅ Headers match DataSet fields
- ✅ Users/groups exist in QuickSight
- ✅ Field names are valid
- ❌ Rejects invalid rows with error messages

### Working with MANUAL Permissions

Handle permissions for un-manageable DataSets that require manual CSV upload.

#### What are MANUAL Permissions?

MANUAL permissions are for **un-manageable DataSets** that cannot be controlled via QuickSight API:

**Un-Manageable DataSets Include**:
- DataSets created by directly uploading files to QuickSight
- Legacy DataSets with unsupported configurations
- DataSets with certain data prep transformations
- Any DataSet that QuickSight API cannot modify

#### Why MANUAL Status?

- 🟠 QuickSight API limitations prevent automated publishing
- 🟠 RLS Manager can still help you create and track permissions
- 🟠 You must manually download CSV and upload to QuickSight
- 🟠 Status remains MANUAL permanently (cannot change to PUBLISHED)

#### MANUAL Workflow

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              MANUAL PERMISSION WORKFLOW                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. CREATE PERMISSIONS      2. DOWNLOAD CSV       3. MANUAL UPLOAD
   ┌──────────────┐          ┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
   │ Use RLS      │    →     │ Export CSV   │  →   │ Upload to    │
   │ Manager UI   │          │ from RLS Mgr │      │ QuickSight   │
   │              │          │              │      │ Console      │
   └──────────────┘          └──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
         ↓                         ↓                      ↓
   🟠 MANUAL Status         CSV Generated          RLS Active in QS
   (Tracked in RLS Mgr)     (Ready to upload)      (You applied it)
```

#### How to Use MANUAL Permissions

**Step 1: Create Permissions in RLS Manager**
1. Select the un-manageable DataSet
2. Add permissions as usual (users, groups, fields, values)
3. Permissions are saved with 🟠 MANUAL status
4. RLS Manager tracks them for you

**Step 2: Download CSV**
1. Open **"Export CSV"** section
2. Click **"Download CSV"**
3. CSV file downloads with all permissions
4. File format: QuickSight RLS format (ready to use)

**Step 3: Upload to QuickSight Manually**
1. Open **QuickSight Console**
2. Navigate to your DataSet
3. Go to **Permissions** tab
4. Click **"Manage row-level security"**
5. Upload the CSV file you downloaded
6. QuickSight applies the RLS rules

**Step 4: Update When Needed**
1. Edit permissions in RLS Manager (still 🟠 MANUAL)
2. Download new CSV
3. Upload to QuickSight again (overwrites previous)
4. Repeat as needed

#### Benefits of Using RLS Manager for MANUAL DataSets

Even though you must manually upload, RLS Manager still provides:

✅ **Visual Interface** - Easier than editing CSV manually
✅ **Permission Tracking** - Keep record of all permissions
✅ **Version History** - Track changes over time (in RLS Manager)
✅ **CSV Generation** - Automatic CSV formatting
✅ **Validation** - Checks for errors before download
✅ **Centralized Management** - Manage all DataSets in one place

#### Limitations of MANUAL Permissions

❌ **No Automated Publishing** - Must manually upload CSV
❌ **No Automatic Sync** - QuickSight changes not reflected in RLS Manager
❌ **No Rollback** - Cannot automatically revert in QuickSight
❌ **Manual Process** - More steps than manageable DataSets
❌ **Status Always MANUAL** - Cannot change to PUBLISHED

#### Converting Un-Manageable to Manageable

To enable automated publishing, you must recreate the DataSet:

**Option 1: Recreate DataSet**
1. Create new DataSet using standard data source (not file upload)
2. Configure same fields and transformations
3. Import permissions from old DataSet
4. Now manageable - can use automated publishing

**Option 2: Use Different Data Source**
1. Upload data to S3, Redshift, or other supported source
2. Create DataSet from that source
3. Now manageable via API

#### Best Practices for MANUAL DataSets

✅ **Document the Process** - Note that this DataSet requires manual upload
✅ **Set Reminders** - Remember to upload CSV after changes
✅ **Test After Upload** - Verify RLS works in QuickSight
✅ **Keep CSV Backups** - Save downloaded CSVs for reference
✅ **Consider Migration** - Evaluate if DataSet can be recreated as manageable

### Refresh Data

Update users, groups, and DataSet information from QuickSight.

#### What Gets Refreshed

- 👥 **Users** - Latest user list from QuickSight
- 👥 **Groups** - Latest group list from QuickSight
- 📊 **DataSets** - Latest DataSet metadata
- 💾 **SPICE Capacity** - Current usage statistics
- 🟠 **MANUAL Permissions** - Detect externally created RLS

#### When to Refresh

- New users or groups added to QuickSight
- DataSet schema changed
- SPICE capacity updated
- Users/groups not appearing in dropdowns
- After creating RLS directly in QuickSight

#### How to Refresh

**From Manage Permissions Page**:
1. Click **"Refresh Data"** button
2. Wait for completion (~10-30 seconds)
3. Dropdowns update automatically
4. MANUAL permissions detected and displayed

**From Global Settings Page**:
1. Navigate to **Global Settings**
2. Click **"Sync Users"** or **"Sync Groups"**
3. Click **"Refresh DataSets"**
4. Return to Manage Permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Status Issues

**Permissions Stuck in PENDING Status**
- ❌ Forgot to click Publish button
- ❌ Publishing workflow not started
- ✅ Solution: Click "Publish" button to apply changes to QuickSight

**Permissions Show FAILED Status**
- ❌ Publishing workflow encountered an error
- ❌ Specific permission has invalid data
- ❌ User/group no longer exists
- ❌ Field name doesn't match DataSet
- ❌ Field value format incorrect
- ❌ Special characters causing issues
- ✅ Solution: 
  - Check CloudWatch logs for specific error message
  - Verify user/group still exists in QuickSight
  - Confirm field names match DataSet schema exactly (case-sensitive)
  - Check for special characters in values (commas, quotes)
  - Verify field data types (strings, numbers, dates)
  - Edit permission to fix the issue
  - Delete and recreate if editing doesn't work
  - Republish to retry

**Common FAILED Permission Causes**:
1. **User Deleted** - User was removed from QuickSight after permission created
2. **Field Renamed** - DataSet field was renamed or removed
3. **Invalid Characters** - Values contain special characters that break CSV format
4. **Data Type Mismatch** - Trying to filter date fields (not supported)
5. **Empty Values** - Field or value is empty/null
6. **Encoding Issues** - Special characters not properly encoded

**Permissions Show MANUAL Status**
- ℹ️ This is expected for un-manageable DataSets
- ℹ️ DataSet cannot be managed via QuickSight API
- ℹ️ Common for file upload DataSets
- ✅ Solution:
  - **This is normal** - MANUAL status is permanent for un-manageable DataSets
  - **Use the workflow**: Create permissions → Download CSV → Upload to QuickSight
  - **To enable automation**: Recreate DataSet using standard data source (not file upload)
  - **Alternative**: Continue using MANUAL workflow (RLS Manager still helps)

**Mix of PUBLISHED and PENDING Permissions**
- ✅ This is normal - you have unpublished changes
- ✅ PUBLISHED permissions are active in QuickSight
- ✅ PENDING permissions are waiting to be published
- ✅ Solution: Review pending changes and publish when ready

#### Publishing Issues

**Publishing Fails at Step 0 (Validation)**
- ❌ AWS resources don't exist
- ❌ IAM permissions insufficient
- ❌ DataSet not manageable
- ✅ Solution: Check [Initialization](Initialization.md) completed successfully

**Publishing Fails at Step 1 (S3)**
- ❌ S3 bucket not accessible
- ❌ Permissions missing
- ❌ Bucket policy blocking access
- ✅ Solution: Verify S3 permissions in IAM

**Publishing Fails at Step 3 (RLS DataSet)**
- ❌ SPICE capacity full
- ❌ DataSource not accessible
- ❌ Glue table issues
- ✅ Solution: Check SPICE capacity, verify DataSource

**Publishing Fails at Step 4 (Apply RLS)**
- ❌ DataSet locked by another operation
- ❌ DataSet configuration incompatible
- ❌ Permissions insufficient
- ✅ Solution: Wait and retry, check DataSet settings

**Publishing Fails at Step 99 (Ingestion)**
- ❌ SPICE ingestion timeout
- ❌ Data source connectivity issues
- ❌ Large dataset taking too long
- ✅ Solution: Check QuickSight console for ingestion status

**RLS Not Working After Publishing**
- ❌ User names don't match exactly
- ❌ Field names incorrect
- ❌ Values case-sensitive mismatch
- ❌ SPICE ingestion not complete
- ✅ Solution: Verify exact matches, wait for ingestion

**Users/Groups Not Appearing**
- ❌ Data not refreshed
- ❌ Users/groups don't exist in QuickSight
- ❌ Management Region incorrect
- ✅ Solution: Refresh data, verify QuickSight setup
