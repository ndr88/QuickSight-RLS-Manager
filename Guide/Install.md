   - **Rate limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks

3. **Example Configurations**

**Allow Corporate Network Only**:
```
Rule: Allow
Type: IP address
Value: 203.0.113.0/24
```

**Block Specific Countries**:
```
Rule: Deny
Type: Country
Value: Select countries to block
```

4. **Save and Test**
   - Rules take effect immediately
   - Test access from allowed/blocked locations
   - Monitor CloudWatch logs for blocked requests

### Optional: Custom Domain

Use your own domain name instead of the default Amplify URL.
